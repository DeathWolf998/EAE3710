# TODO for this week

Designers: Start discussing & noting how the gamve should function on a round-to-round basis; what items should be purchasable from the shop other than different pinballs or machine parts?

Artists: Start designing basic assets for the base versions of flippers, the basic pinball, and maybe some basic bumpers or spinners. It may also be a good idea to sketch out two versions of the pinball table: one with pegs (where machine bits will be placed) and another where the gameplay proper will take place.

Programmers: Get github set up for everyone, and make sure to get base pinball gameplay working as much as is reasonable (flippers flip, plungers plunge, bumpers bump, items affect score as necessary, etc)
